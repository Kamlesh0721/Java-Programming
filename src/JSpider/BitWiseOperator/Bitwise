Day - 1
Bitwise operator is used to operate on binary bits of a number.
There are :
    1 - Bitwise OR ( | )
    2 - Bitwise AND ( & )
    3 - Bitwise XOR ( ^ )
    4 - Bitwise Complement/Bitwise NOT( ~ )
    5 - Bitwise Right Shift ( >> )
    6 - Bitwise Left Shift ( << )
    7 - Bitwise Unsigned Right Shift ( >>> )

Binary Representation : ( of Positive Number)

Bitwise OR ( | ):
Bitwise OR takes two binary bits and if at least one binary bit is 1 then it becomes 1 otherwise it will be 0.

Bitwise AND ( & ):
Bitwise AND takes two binary bits and if both binary bits are 1 then it will be 1 otherwise it will be 0.

Bitwise XOR ( ^ ):
Bitwise XOR takes two binary bits if both are same then it will be 0 otherwise it will be 1.

Bitwise Right Shift Operator ( >> )
Bitwise Right Shift Operator is used to shift binary bits of a number into right side by the given value
ex - 40 >> 3
the binary bits of 40 will shift 3 position to right
