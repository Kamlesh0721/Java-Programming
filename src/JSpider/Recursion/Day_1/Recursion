Recursion:
When a method calls itself then it is called recursion.
It can be achieved in 3 ways :
    1- By calling same method from inside method body.
    2- By calling same method from method argument at the time of method call.
    3- By calling same method from return statement.

 1- By calling same method from inside method body.
   *  A method can call itself from inside method body which makes method to execute repeatedly.
   * If it is not controlled then It will cause an error called stack overflow error.
   * We can avoid stack overflow error by controlling recursion using flow control statement.
